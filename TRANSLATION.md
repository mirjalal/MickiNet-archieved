## How to translate
Translating MickiNet is extremely easy. You just need to understand English and be fluent in the language you're translating to. 
I'm on the way to deliver the app to simplify it even more, but for now you just need to translate json file.

## 1st
Please go to [PRs list] and lookup your language. If translation is there, no translation is required - all translations 
will be merged soon.

## 2nd
Grab the latest version of [json-file with English]. Cut and paste this file to your text editor. Save file as `your_language.json` 
(for example: `turkce.json`, `česky.json`, `українська.json` and etc.). If you familiar with git and GitHub, just fork MickiNet and 
do all the work here and on the next steps in your repo.

## 3rd
If there are, please translate the words with keeping the `<b></b>` HTML tag(s).

## Final!
Contribute! If you know how git and GitHub works, just create pull request. If you submit translation, you don't need to run tests, 
update code base, etc. Just submit translation file and MickiNet team will do the rest for you.

If you don't know how git and GitHub works, just upload your file to [gist.github.com] or [paste2]. After upload [Send a link to me].

## You're done!
Thanks for translating MickiNet and making this project more awesome for people around the world!
